# Contact-form ☎️
This contact form uses html, css, javascript, and php.
I am learning how to use more javascript and php in my projects. I want to send and receive information.

Doing this project, I learned how to utilize more javascript and learned how to use some php.

I have downloaded XAMPP and learned how to run my project in a local host by enabling MySQL and Apache. I learned how to run my project by adding my website folder in the htdocs folder, and entering the file path to the index.html into the browser search bar to reach it and test the PHP.

Here is an example of how the path should look: localhost/contact-form/index.html

I have also learned how to be patient, take small breaks, and ask better questions.

If you have any tips for me and ways to improve my code, please let me know. I followed a tutorial on Youtube by CodingNepal.

Since Github only hosts static pages, the form will not work in the environment. 
If you know of any servers I can use for free to test my php projects, please let me know!

Next courses of action ✅:
